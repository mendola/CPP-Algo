In order to find a solution to the knapsack problem without exhaustively testing all possible combinations of items, we implemented a greedy algorithm. In order to speed
up the algorithm on large instances, our algorithm uses the heuristic of always picking the remaining item with maximum ratio of value to cost that still fits in the 
knapsack. Our results show that this algorithm is NOT optimal. In the previous project, we completed an exhaustive search for knapsack sizes up through 28 items, thus we
do know the optimal solutions for these 5 instances. Of these 5 instances, our greedy algorithm only found the optimal solution for sizes 12, and the exhaustive algorithm
even beat the greedy algorithm for the first instance for which it timed out. However, for instances larger than 32 items, the greedy algorithm vastly outperformed the 
exhaustive search, with the margin between the two getting orders of magnitude bigger as the instance size increased. Furthermore, the greedy algorithm ran on all 12 instances
in less than a second, while the exhaustive algorithm took 10 minutes just for one of the instances larger than 28 items. 

While the greedy algorithm is not optimal for this problem, it's clear that using a greedy algorithm is still better than attempting an exhastive search for large instances.
